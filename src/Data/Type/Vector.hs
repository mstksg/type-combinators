-- 'V' and its combinator analog 'VT' represent lists
-- of known length, characterized by the index @(n :: N)@ in
-- @'V' n a@ or @'VT' n f a@.
--
-- The classic example used ad nauseum for type-level programming.
--
-- The operations on 'V' and 'VT' correspond to the type level arithmetic
-- operations on the kind 'N'.
